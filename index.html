<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">The idea behind the <em>DoMuHo</em> theory is to classify natural actions occurring at a&nbsp;quantum level&nbsp;based on their energy, complexity, and influence on other quantum systems. The three categories in this theory are:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Donkey Work (Do):</strong>&nbsp;These are low-energy, simple&nbsp;quantum interactions&nbsp;that are relatively isolated from other systems. They have minimal impact on the overall behavior of the&nbsp;quantum systems&nbsp;they are a part of. Examples could include small-scale thermal fluctuations or minor quantum decoherence events.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Mule Work&nbsp;(Mu):</strong>&nbsp;Mule Work represents intermediate-energy, moderately complex quantum interactions that have a more significant influence on their surroundings. These events could involve the entanglement of&nbsp;multiple quantum states&nbsp;or the formation of&nbsp;coherent superposition&nbsp;states.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Horse Work&nbsp;(Ho):</strong>&nbsp;These are high-energy, highly complex quantum interactions that have a substantial impact on the quantum systems they are a part of and their surroundings. Horse Work events could involve significant quantum tunneling processes, large-scale entanglement, or the emergence of new&nbsp;quantum states&nbsp;through&nbsp;spontaneous symmetry&nbsp;breaking.</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Since this theory&nbsp;is based on energy, complexity, and influence, we could establish thresholds for each category based on these criteria. For example:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Donkey Work (Do):</strong>&nbsp;Any&nbsp;quantum interaction&nbsp;with an energy level below E1, complexity below C1, and influence below I1 would fall under this category.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Mule Work (Mu):</strong>&nbsp;Quantum interactions with energy levels between E1 and E2, complexity between C1 and C2, and influence between I1 and I2 would be classified as Mule Work.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Horse Work (Ho):</strong>&nbsp;Finally, quantum interactions with&nbsp;energy levels&nbsp;above E2, complexity above C2, and influence above I2 would be considered Horse Work.</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>
